MICROSOFT STUDIO VENTURE


PROJECT OVERVIEW
In this project I analyze the studio movie industry. I use analysis to identify the high rating movies and Microsoft 
can use the information to know the kind of movies to produce.

Business Problem

•Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they 
want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but 
they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring 
what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then 
translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new 
movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

This project uses descriptive analytics including changes in trends over time & comparative analysis between movie
features. This provides meaningful insight in movie industry trends.


Results

Question 1: What are the current trends in the movie industry? Since 2019 the movie industry has made of 80 billion dollars
and more than 250 studios have released 3,000 movies into theaters. There was a boom in the number of movies that were
produced between 2010 and 2015 as well as a dramatic spike in the number of movie studios. Since then there has been a
31.56% drop in the number of movies produced between 2015 & 2018. Most recent data shows that 308 movies were
released in 2018. On average studios produce between 7 & 14 movies per year and 76 studios released movies in 2018.


Question 2: What percentage of the market do the top earning movies occupy?
In 2018 movies grossed over 11 billion dollars domestically. Of that, the gross for the top 5 highest earners accounted for
over 2 billion dollars. These 5 movies were produced by only 3 studios but accounted for almost 25% of the total domestic
gross.


Question 3: Based on the top 5 domestic grossing movies what type of movie should Microsoft produce? Of the top 5
grossing movies since 2010 71% can be classified into the "Action" genre. Within that genre 98% aslo classify themselves
as "Adventure". Further breaking down the genes - "Comedy" emerges as a low saturation/ high yield sub Action genre. The
majority of the movies within this category are either PG or PG-13. Finally ther is a strong correlation (0.97) between
domestic gross and release date of movies.


Conclusions

Based on these findings the recommendations to Microsoft are as follows:
1. Microsoft should target producing 10 movies in year 1 of production.
2. In order to optimize profit potential, Microsoft should emulate the top five highest earning movies in at least half of
their first-year productions.
3. Microsoft should produce an Action-Adventure Comedy with a PG Rating and a mid-February release.
